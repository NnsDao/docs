After clicking on claim airdrop, we have added a sharing benefit, you can share it by clicking on the Twitter icon, and you will be rewarded with a certain number of NDPs officially given by NnsDAO after successful sharing.

Note that the number of NDPs given away in this sharing activity is limited, so act fast.

## IV. whitelist user rebate

About the whitelist of previous airdrop users

Whitelist users are the most sincere partners of our project. In order to reward whitelist users for their previous support to our project, we will provide you with an exclusive channel to hold ndp, which will enable you to subscribe ndp at a lower price.

You can exercise this subscription right at your own discretion or at any time within 15 days after the swap goes live (if there is still a subscription quantity, please contact the administrator to confirm the remaining amount in real time).

If you are lucky enough to be on the whitelist and would like to receive more and longer term project side dividends by holding more ndp Please contact us by email to subscribe for more detailed information.

We would like to express our sincere gratitude to our long-term supporters and continue to generate income for our NDP holders, so that we can work together to build the hottest DAO project on the IC ecosystem. Join us.

Thank you again for your contribution to NDP.
