### When is NDP available for transactions?

For NDP trading you can check the pass equity section of NnsDAO. We will circulate through the marketplace, NFT, and game ecology before SWAP goes live, and when the ICP ecology swap goes live, we will follow up and access the swap and provide liquidity. At present we have briefly communicated with Icpswap, and when Icpswap is available for liquidity trading, NDP will add the corresponding trading pairs.

### About previously sponsored users

For all previous sponsors, we will collect the address and Principal ID of Stoicwallet separately for claiming, and we will collect them after the contribution activity starts. After the collection is finished, we will unify the claim rights and benefits.
