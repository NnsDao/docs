ICmarket - DAO-based subDAO marketplace.

ICmarket is a „Äådiversified„Äç „Äåtradable„Äçplatform for NFTs, which provides user-directed creation and collaboration. It also provides subDAO to join and create the common collections and collaborative NFTs.

## Derivatives Aggregation

Interaction between different Canister, dApps under the constraints of IC protocols, such as reputation, NFTs collateralized lending, used to empower DeFi.

## Unlimited Creations

An open creation center where users can freely create and buy, sell, collect, initiate subDAO co-creations and purchase.

## Ecological cross-chain

With the advantage of IC, the anti-gas model can be realized by the end of 2022, and cross-chain issuance and trading with mainstream public chains such as Bitcoin and ETH.

## Create, trade rewards

All collections will now generate a trading bonus. There is no minimum trade volume requirement - every time you buy or sell NFT of any collection on ICmarket, you earn NDP/ICP and collection creators can collect up to 10% royalties.

## Everything can be NFTs

ICmarket platform content can be sourced from NnsDAO and Dfinity ecology, such as podcast ep, game props, Icptree skins, special reputation, etc.

## Non-custodial (**Non-custodial**)

All assets are under your full control, displaying your own PFP and PIS via protocol on Web3 applications.
