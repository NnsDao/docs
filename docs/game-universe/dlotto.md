## Game Rules

IC Lottery costs 0.1 ICP per play.

The player self selects that they are over 18 years (no validation).

The player selects four numbers from 1 to 24 for the white balls; then selects one number from 1 to 10 for the red bonus ball.

The player needs a minimum of 1 ticket to play. They can purchase as many tickets as they like.

The numbers are automatically chosen for the player by default. The player can change the numbers and self select them.
