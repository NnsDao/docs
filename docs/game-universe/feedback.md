Hello, having played with poker players, encountered certain problems.

1. The game hangs, I use an android, on the PC can not even enter.

2. After each hand requires confirmation of readiness this further slows down the process of the game (add buttons to get up from the table and sit down).

3. Change the position of the bets as you can accidentally press all-in or fold, and move the hotel to the bottom. ( correct the design). Conclusion : after spending 10 min I played only 3 hands, players left or left because of ignorance, the game process is long and not dynamic, in 70% of cases the waiting time is high, if I use the application in this way it is possible to lose users because the centralized applications work faster and more dynamic and the waiting time is minimal

I forgot to say. It is a good idea to add another section to the Airdrop section to give group members a better understanding of nnsdao. My suggestion is to create a form that asks questions about the mechanism and nature of nnsdao so that members have to read the whitepaper to answer it. The selected members will then be eligible for the Airdrop Reward

what is your opinion?

Of course, to give sovereignty to users and investors, there is a need for tokenization.
However, in order to prevent the creation of whales in this category of tokens, different mechanisms must be used. Because otherwise it could lead to a dictatorship in the Dapp governance

For example, a limit on the number of tokens per person. Assigning tokens to different communities through the related DAOs of each community. For example, developers's DAO, influencers's DAO, users's DAO, and so on

To make sure no group is able to concentrate power in a dapp in a coordinated manner. If this principle is not observed, dictatorship and concentration of power cannot be prevented
