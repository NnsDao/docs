# How to simply explain METAVERSE?

The word metaverse is originated from novel and trying to bring idea as metaverse is a persistent virtual world navigated by the aptly-named protagonist Hiro Protagonist. Metaverse is made of two words such as meta and verse where by meta means going beyond while verse means universe. So metaverse is about technological concept that goes beyond our current universe of neatly delineated physical and virtual worlds. Literally it is widely believed that its development will be an economic boon worth trillions of dollars.

The metaverse is on the way though its utopian advocates claim that the next iteration of the internet will free us from the physical world. However Web 1.0 is a warning from history and quickly became dominated by big business and government. Welcome to the metaverse as the next iteration of the internet where, its advocates believe, we will all work, play, and socialize in the coming years and decades. At stake is whether this next generation internet which is known as Web 3.0 or the spatial web that will be much like todayâ€™s, with proprietary platforms such as Facebook and Google that monetize user data, or if it will be open and decentralized, free from the control of a handful of big tech companies. 

The metaverse is a digital reality that combines aspects of social media, online gaming, augmented reality (AR), virtual reality (VR), and cryptocurrencies to allow users to interact virtually. Augmented reality overlays visual elements, sound, and other sensory input onto real-world settings to enhance the user experience. In contrast, virtual reality is entirely virtual and enhances fictional realities.

As the metaverse grows, it will create online spaces where user interactions are more multidimensional than current technology supports. Instead of just viewing digital content, users in the metaverse will be able to immerse themselves in a space where the digital and physical worlds converge. 

+ The metaverse can be described according to the following concepts
    + The metaverse is all about shared virtual environment that people access through the internet
    + The metaverse is combination of technologies like virtual reality(VR) and augmented reality(AR) in order to create the sense of virtual presence
