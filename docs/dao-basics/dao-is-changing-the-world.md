# DAO is changing the world

Author:[papapa31](https://h5aet-waaaa-aaaab-qaamq-cai.raw.ic0.app/u/papapa31)

Looking back at the history of human development, each major epidemic would change the course of history. Around 1350 A.D., a plague of Mongolian origin swept through Europe, claiming tens of millions of lives and reducing Europe's population by a third. But in the view of some historians, it was the plague that gave birth to modern Western civilization.

The plague led to the death of a large number of young adults and a sharp decline in labor, resulting in a critical shortage of tenant farmers and serfs on the feudal lords' estates, which shook the foundations of the feudal sharecropping system. The lack of labor and expensive labor directly drove tool improvement and technological innovation. After the bloody storm of the bubonic plague, many feudal countries in Europe were reborn from the devastation and began to move towards a modern society and commercial economy, modernizing their social economy, increasing investment in technological inventions, and encouraging overseas expansion. With these three cornerstones, Western Europe quickly became powerful and later became the richest and strongest region in the world.

With this global epidemic in 2020, we can also discuss what changes have been brought about?
I think the most important event is this: the massive printing of money in the U.S. has led to a major deflation of the dollar, which keeps pushing up the U.S. government debt ceiling. At the same time, it pushes the prices of various assets to new highs. It goes without saying that the consequences of the big dollar deflation will produce a more serious global financial crisis in 2022 than in 2008, some experts predict.

## Why does printing more dollars lead to a global financial crisis?

I'll give you a simple answer to the relationship: we all know that the dollar is also called [U.S. gold], how did this name come about, said the outbreak of World War II in 1944, most of the world's participating countries in order to prevent the loss of gold, the gold was shipped to the territory of the United States did not participate in the war.

When World War II was over, these countries wanted that gold back and were faced with two options： 1、Transport the gold back to the country, but it is extremely unsafe in transportation. 2、Make gold coupons according to the proportion of gold stored in each country, distribute the gold coupons to each country according to the proportion of gold stored in the U.S., and then each country will print its own currency according to the proportion of gold in the gold coupons (because basically, they are settled according to the gold reserves).

This time, the United States jumped in and said no need to be so troublesome, after the dollar and our stockpile of gold correspondence, how much gold, we will print how many dollars, you will use the dollar as the basis for the conditions, print their own national currency can be. Because the United States is the victorious country, plus there is gold as the basis for settlement, various countries have chosen this method. This led to the use of the U.S. dollar, also known as the [U.S. gold], as the only currency for reserve transactions and settlements for the next 30 years around the world. At one point, more than 160 countries around the world were printing their own currencies based on how many dollars they had in reserve.

### U.S. Unilaterally Unpegs Dollar from Gold

Everything seemed to be a problem for the United States, and countries agreed to the U.S. plan. As a result, 30 years later, U.S. President Richard Nixon unilaterally announced that the dollar and gold decoupling, after the dollar only and the United States credit related, the United States want to print as many dollars can be. This led to the following decades all over the world but all powerful countries began to do one thing - to decouple from the dollar, to their own reserves of gold (or the amount of gold stored in the United States) to print their own currency. But as of today there are still over 70 countries around the world that use the dollar as a settlement (decades of settlement habits, they can't get rid of the dollar). This also leads to the fact that once the dollar is printed casually, the currency of those countries that use the dollar as a settlement becomes waste paper (for example: the Venezuelan currency), which has become the biggest factor leading to the global financial crisis.

### So are there winners in this massive release of dollars?

Of course there is, and there is no bigger winner than [BTC], which has truly become a store of value and is starting to enter the balance sheets of public companies like Tesla and become legal tender in El Salvador ......

### The epidemic brings new wealth opportunities - Metaverse

Because of the epidemic, people need to be isolated at home, economic pressure has increased steeply, although there is this form of telecommuting, but many small and micro enterprises still can not avoid the fate of a number of closures, people all kinds of energy and passion that can not be consumed in the real world, began to turn to the virtual world, a new term into the eyes of people - metaverse

### Metaverse has become a new habitat for time and money

People can not only have fun by playing games in the virtual world, but also earn significant income through blockchain chain games such as Axie Infinity and NFT-GODS. All this really affects everyone's fate and changes their life trajectory. For example, a young Filipino who used to have to work outside the home to earn a living can now earn much more than before with Axie. At the same time, social opinion has shifted to the left, and people all over the world seem to hate big companies more and more, and the former entrepreneurial heroes have become the capitalists who are "scorned".

### A new choice for a new era - DAO

The metaverse concept, the telecommuting wave, the rise of virtual worlds, and the public opinion crusade against large corporations ...... have led to the rapid rise of a new organizational form, the DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization). DAO is not a brand new concept, but it has been pushed to the center stage under the current of the times. Compared with the companies of the past, DAO offers more possibilities: distributed globally, linked online, with shared benefits ...... seems to give a glimpse of the dawn and direction of Web 3.0.

### What is DAO?

DAO is an acronym for decentralized autonomousorganization. It is decentralized because it has no formal leadership; it is autonomous because it allows any member to make decisions.The easiest way to understand this is to think of a DAO as a corporation, and there are many similarities between the two, such as:

organizing people for a cause.

solving certain problems by creating value. 3、Provide an opportunity to create wealth (not only for individuals, but also for the whole society).

### DAO is the better company

A DAO has countless benefits over a traditional company. It has no formal roles or hierarchy, and its decisions are made by a vote of the entire staff. a DAO relies on voluntary labor. People provide value in a DAO because they voluntarily choose to, and the quality of the workforce increases exponentially.

The motivation between day-to-day routine work and deep engagement with a favorite application is simply not comparable. For example, a public company with thousands of employees and a DAO organization with a core of 20 engineers. Despite the difference in workforce size, both handle similar workloads and are even more efficient at certain times of the day.

In addition, DAO addresses the most pressing issues facing companies today:Participant's upside

### Participant's upside

In a traditional company, the investors (leaders) own the company and everything of value captured by the company goes directly to them, while the workers involved in the labor are only minimally paid. But a DAO is owned by the community, and all value captured by the DAO goes into the DAO's system, with everyone having the right to an equal share of the return.

DAO is not only more efficient than traditional companies, but also better for us ordinary people to provide better opportunities to create wealth. It solves social conflicts extremely well. Therefore, I personally believe that DAO is very likely to replace traditional companies and become the new choice in the new era.
