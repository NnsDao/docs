NnsDao is the decentralized autonomous organization that adopting permission less and censorship resistant technology in order to achieve self-sovereignty, security and prosperity. This is the steward movement that progressing the world towards a future of greater freedom. NnsDAO is seeking to become a trusted guide that empowers people all over the globe to adopt decentralization by sharing accurate truthful and objective information. 

NnsDAO is operating transparently and build trust through radically public discourse and financial auditability.  In fact NnsDAO we put decision making into the hands of the collective through creating legitimacy in the environment where the best ideas win. These decisions are governed by proposals and voting to ensure everyone in the organization has a voice. 

Eventually with DAOs you don’t need to trust anyone else in the group instead just the DAO’s Code which is 100% transparent and verifiable by anyone. This is another way to open up so many new opportunities for global collaboration and coordination. 

Literally NnsDAO we have culture that enhanced reward action and embrace risk through empowering our community to continually drive new initiatives by providing a space to self-organize and quickly move from idea to action as well. 

This is some sort of collective conviction that going in the journey towards freedom, self-sovereignty and financial independence. This is how NnsDAO we are doing in the community of Dfinity.
