## 3.Advantages of Papyrs

For content blogging platforms, in the past we have seen different content providers such as Google Blogger, medium, substack, etc., but none of them have solved the problem of data sovereignty and creator economy, while experiencing Papyrs I see this possibility and its perfect experience, I believe this is a real web3 blogging platform, and the data and content belongs to the users, In the future they will create a new model of content subscription.
